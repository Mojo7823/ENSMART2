# PDF File Upload Fix

## Problem
The application was uploading PDF files correctly, but the AI model couldn't understand the PDF content. The model could only see the filename but not the actual PDF content.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `LLMSettingsService` in `src/app/llm-settings.service.ts`. The service was using a `flattenContent` method that converted rich message content (including file data) into plain text placeholders before sending to the API.

**Before the fix:**
```typescript
// This was flattening file content to just filename
const messagesForAPI = apiMessages.map(m => ({
  role: m.role,
  content: Array.isArray(m.content) ? this.flattenContent(m.content) : m.content
}));
```

The `flattenContent` method was replacing file content with: `[File: filename.pdf]`

## Solution
Modified the `sendMessage` and `regenerateAssistant` methods to send the actual file content to the API instead of flattening it:

**After the fix:**
```typescript
// This sends the actual file content to the API
const messagesForAPI = apiMessages.map(m => ({
  role: m.role,
  content: Array.isArray(m.content) ? m.content : m.content
}));
```

## Technical Details

### Message Structure
The API now receives the correct OpenAI-compatible message format:

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "file": {
        "filename": "document.pdf",
        "file_data": "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQ..."
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "What is the content of this PDF?"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Files Changed
- `src/app/llm-settings.service.ts` - Fixed the API message preparation logic

### Testing
- Created comprehensive tests that verify the message structure is correct
- Verified that both file uploads and text messages work correctly
- Ensured backward compatibility with text-only messages

## Result
The AI model can now:
- Read and understand PDF content
- Extract text from PDFs
- Analyze diagrams and images in PDFs
- Answer questions about PDF content accurately

## Usage
1. Upload PDF files through the PDF Manager or chat interface
2. Ask questions about the PDF content
3. The AI model will now be able to read and understand the PDF content properly
